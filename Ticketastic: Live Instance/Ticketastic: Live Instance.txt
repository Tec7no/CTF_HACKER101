hello again.

first u most look at demo website .

After looking i get all post req i found .

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+                1./newUser                     +
+                2./ticket?id=                  +
+    3./newUser?username=&password=&password2=  +
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


that's i found okay .

let's back again to live one and we see now we can try to exploit the 3rd req .

and create a new user and log in specaially we this website same structure of the demo so it must work .

ops...there is session check and we got u not logged .

let's try to login using these "username = admin & password = admin" okay we have a msg Invalid password .

so we can try use hydra to bruite force the password .

After using hydra there is a limit of trying u can't use it 4 long .

okay what we can do now?

when i try in demo exploit html tags it work no filter on it .

we have a submit form the admin he can see it and interact with .

okay what about if this admin create a new admin ?

so let's create a hyperlink when he click on create one on his localserver .

payload "<a href="http://localhost/newUser?username=test&password=test&password2=test">Test</a>"

After a while it's work .

u can logging now and there is a flag appare .

== flag 2 ==
============

okay from the second post link i found "2./ticket?id=" we can use sql injection let's try .

when u try to submit in wrong format there is an error appere contaim MARIA DB that's nice .

we are OG guys now xD .

so we need to know what is the version of this DB and what is her name ? 

we can search on that .

i found it "UNION SELECT VERSION(),DATABASE(),3--" .

u can now use a random number on id and inject this payload u will retrive the data u need .

okay now we need to find our data "table name and our columns" .

i tried fast users tabel xD cause if there is a table name it must be users in programing 

table name must be plural and column is singular .

but u can search about payload to use i found one 
"UNION SELECT 1,GROUP_CONCAT(TABLE_NAME),3 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA=DATABASE()--" .

then u can inject what u need 

i used "UNION SELECT * from users " and i got a flag .

happy hacking .
